# zelda-minish-cap-jp-text-dump

This is a text dump generator for the japanese verion of the minish cap!

## To Use
To run it as a command it should be `exe [game file] [text table offset]`
otherwise you can simply drag and drop the game onto the exe.

### Planned
  - Add english version support.
  - Add support for literal translations of the japanese done by fans to be pulled into the final document.
